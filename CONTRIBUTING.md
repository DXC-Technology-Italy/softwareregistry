We follow the [Conventional Commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
and the general rules of **[great commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)** (read this!)

## Gitflow

This repository adopts a simplified branch management system as follows:

* `main` is stable and gets deployed automatically. Never push directly to it;
* feature or fix branches are derived directly from master.

### Releases

The maintainers try to keep the milestones updated in order to show what will be
fixed soon and, when possible, they also try to set a consistent end date for
such a milestone to be hit.
